# Holocene Design Summary (Tier 0)

> **Your personal geological record of the present**

**Read this file first in every Claude session.** This is Tier 0 - optimized for AI context efficiency.

---

## What is Holocene?

Holocene is a **privacy-first personal knowledge management and activity tracking system** with two operating modes:

1. **Autonomous Mode** - Background agent with continuous monitoring
2. **On-Demand Mode** - Interactive assistant for research and analysis

**Core Philosophy:**
- Track behavior, not content
- Privacy by design (3-tier model)
- Human-in-the-loop for all consequential actions
- Tool that assists rather than agent that acts

---

## Two Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Autonomous (Background Monitoring)
**Status:** Planned (not yet implemented)

Continuous daemon that:
- Auto-logs activities every 30-60 seconds from multiple data sources
- Sends periodic check-ins to LLM (~30-50/day via DeepSeek V3)
- Executes IFTTT-style automation rules (user-approved)
- Generates daily/weekly summaries automatically
- Vibrates Mi Band for break reminders

**Data Sources (future):**
- Browser extension (Chrome/Edge, unpublished)
- Window focus tracking (OS-level)
- System metrics (CPU/RAM patterns)
- Home Assistant sensors (temp, humidity, presence)
- Google Calendar events
- Mi Band (heart rate, sleep, activity)
- journel logs ✅ (implemented)
- Git activity ✅ (implemented)

### Mode 2: On-Demand (Interactive)
**Status:** Implemented ✅

User-initiated queries and tasks:
- `holo status` - Activity summary
- `holo analyze --week` - AI pattern analysis
- `holo research start "topic"` - Deep research compilation
- `holo books`, `holo papers`, `holo links` - Knowledge management
- `holo print` - Thermal printing via Spinitex

---

## LLM Strategy (NanoGPT $8/month)

**Model Routing** - Specialized LLMs for different tasks:
- **DeepSeek V3** (primary) - Daily synthesis, pattern detection, general tasks (128K context)
- **Qwen 3 Coder** - Code generation/review (often better than DS V3 for coding)
- **DeepSeek R1** - Complex reasoning chains, step-by-step thinking
- **Hermes 4 Large** - Verification, cross-checking DS V3 outputs
- **Llama 3B** (canary) - Lightweight injection detection, pre-screening
- **Math specialists** - Geostatistical calculations

**Budget:** 2,000 prompts/day (60,000/month) - currently using ~25/day (0.04%)

---

## Privacy Architecture

### Three-Tier Privacy Model

**Tier 1: Safe for External APIs (NanoGPT)**
- Generic activity descriptions
- Personal project details (open-source work)
- Time patterns, categories
- Home Assistant data, Google Calendar, Mi Band data

**Tier 2: Local Only (Future M4 Mac Mini)**
- Specific work context
- Screenshot analysis (manual only, vision models)
- Gmail content
- Detailed documents

**Tier 3: Never Logged**
- Financial data, production numbers
- Unreleased exploration results
- Confidential work information
- Anything marked sensitive

### Sanitization Layer
Every activity filtered BEFORE storage:
- Blocked domains → rejected
- Blacklisted keywords → redacted to `[REDACTED]`
- Sensitive paths → rejected
- URLs → stripped to `[URL]`

---

## Task Scheduler System

**Status:** Planned (not yet implemented)

Three task types:
1. **One-shot** - Single LLM call, immediate response
2. **Long-running** - Multi-day execution with state persistence (e.g., process 3000 links over 60 days)
3. **Background** - Low priority, scheduled execution

**Features:**
- Checkpoint/resume capability
- Priority queue
- Daily budget limits (e.g., 50 items/day)
- State tracking in database

---

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Implemented (On-Demand Mode)
- Manual activity logging with privacy sanitization
- SQLite storage with full CRUD
- CLI interface (`holo` command via Click)
- **DeepSeek V3.1 integration** via NanoGPT API
- Budget tracking (2000 calls/day monitored)
- **journel integration** (reads 8 active projects)
- **Git activity tracking** (scans local repos)
- **Internet Archive integration** (1,153+ links with trust tiers)
- **Link management** (extraction, deduplication, bookmarks import)
- **Book collection** (70 books from IA + LibraryThing)
- **Book enrichment** (LLM-generated summaries/tags)
- **Deep research mode** (overnight compilation, markdown reports)
- **PDF handling** (text extraction + OCR fallback)
- **Thermal printing** (Spinitex renderer + Paperang P1)
- **Wikipedia search** (free API integration)
- **Academic papers** (Crossref API planned)

### ⏳ Not Yet Implemented (Autonomous Mode)
- Background daemon
- Browser extension for passive tracking
- Window focus monitoring
- Home Assistant integration
- Mi Band notifications
- Google Calendar integration
- IFTTT rule engine
- Automated daily/weekly summaries
- Task scheduler with long-running tasks

---

## Security & Safety

### Prompt Injection Defense (Layered)

1. **Architectural** - Don't fetch full web content, use structured APIs
2. **Quarantine System** - All external summaries reviewed by user before entering context
3. **Multi-model Verification** - DS V3 → Llama 3B canary → Hermes 4 → User approval
4. **Heuristic Pre-filters** - Regex patterns for common injection attempts
5. **Honeypot Tools** - Fake tools that trigger red flags if LLM tries to use them

### Automation Boundaries

**Allowed:**
- IFTTT-style rules (user-approved)
- Mi Band vibrations for reminders
- Home Assistant service calls (whitelisted)
- Daily/weekly summary generation

**Not Allowed:**
- Autonomous code execution without approval
- Self-modification of rules/behavior
- Recursive agent creation
- File system access outside designated zones
- POST/PUT/DELETE requests to external APIs

---

## Current Priorities (from ROADMAP.md)

**Phase 4.1 - Free Knowledge APIs (In Progress):**
1. Wikipedia integration into research reports
2. Crossref academic papers (165M papers, FREE)
3. Internet Archive public domain book discovery

**Future:**
- Kagi Universal Summarizer (PDF/link summaries, ~$3-15/month)
- Calibre library integration (when library migrated)
- Autonomous background monitoring mode
- Browser extension development

---

## Technology Stack

**Core:**
- Python 3.11+

- Wikipedia REST API (article summaries)
- Crossref REST API (academic papers - planned)
- pyusb (Paperang P1 thermal printer)
- PDFPlumber + pytesseract (PDF text extraction + OCR)

**Future:**

---

## Key Integrations

### Spinitex - Thermal Printing Typography Engine
**Location:** `src/holocene/integrations/paperang/spinitex.py`

TeX-inspired markdown renderer for thermal printers (named after spinifex texture in komatiites - geology pun on "ultra-basic TeX").

**Features:**
- Markdown with inline styles (bold, italic, code)
- Text alignment (left, center, right) + split with `\hfill`
- Image embedding with 8 dithering algorithms
- Non-breaking headers (auto font-size reduction)
- Physical dimensions (PPI, margins in mm)
- Ligature support (Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, Iosevka)

**See:** `design/integrations/thermal_printing.md` for details

### Deep Research Mode
**Command:** `holo research start "topic"`

Overnight research compilation using spare API credits:
- Searches book collection, papers, Wikipedia
- LLM analysis and synthesis
- Generates comprehensive markdown reports
- Pre-LLM source prioritization (trust tiers)

**See:** `design/integrations/research_mode.md` for details

---

## Trust Tier System (Security Feature)

Links categorized by Internet Archive snapshot date:

- **🟢 pre-llm** (before Nov 2022) - Lowest injection risk, ideal for LLM analysis
- **🟡 early-llm** (Nov 2022 - Jan 2024) - Medium risk
- **🔴 recent** (Jan 2024+) - Highest risk, requires careful sanitization
- **⚪ unknown** - No archive date, treat with maximum caution

**Purpose:** Safer LLM-based content analysis by preferring pre-LLM era sources.
